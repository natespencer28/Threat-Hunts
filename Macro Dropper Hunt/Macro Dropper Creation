Scenario 1 – The Malicious Macro Dropper
Story:
An employee in your finance department opens an “urgent invoice” sent from a spoofed vendor email. The invoice contains a macro that, if enabled, would normally download a malicious payload from an attacker’s server. In our simulation, we’ll use PowerShell to download a harmless text file and place it in a suspicious location.

Simulation Steps:

Create the “macro payload” simulation:

********
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/natespencer28/Threat-Hunts/refs/heads/main/Macro%20Dropper%20Hunt/Macro%20Dropper%20Creation" -OutFile "$env:APPDATA\invoice_payload.txt"
********

Mimic persistence by creating a fake registry run key:

New-ItemProperty -Path "HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" -Name "InvoiceLoader" -Value "$env:APPDATA\invoice_payload.txt"
Hunting Goal:

Search in Sentinel for Invoke-WebRequest execution events.

Look for new registry persistence entries.

Detect file creation in unusual directories (AppData in this case).
